# Code and Run YOLOv8

This chpater will teach you how to clone the **YOLO’s source code** from **ultralytics**’ repository, and run the model by default.

### Clone Repository

The source code can be stored in many ways. bc model’s source could be large and massive, I recommend to store code in drive rather than Jetson Orin Nano itselves. 

The way I use to store the code is **NAS (Network Attached File System)**, and use the *resilio-sync* to cache the file. It allows me to edit code on more powerful and convinent system like a Mac.

The tutorial of NAS will be created later. The way to store the code is totally up to you.

```shell
# Choose or create the directory to store your code
cd ~/Documents
# Git clone
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics.git
# Mainland China
git clone https://gitclone.com/github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics.git
```

After cloning the repository, go to ubuntu launch pad and **open the VSCode**

Click the python extension on the **left sidebar,** you can easliy see the global environments, and the **conda environments we just created.** Here, we can **manage the packages installed** like update, remove.

### Code the YOLOv8

First, we should download the detection model of YOLOv8, [Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/#supported-tasks-and-modes). For Jetson orin nano, I prefer nano and small model, **[YOLOv8n](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v8.2.0/yolov8n.pt)** and **[YOLOv8s](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v8.2.0/yolov8s.pt)**. 

```shell
# move the .pt file into our ultralytics working directory
mv ~/Downloads/sth.pt ~/Documents/Ultralytics/
```

Then, open the folder that we cloning the source code. You should have a similar project structure with mine.

Create a new python file named `train.py`, this simple code import the neccesary packages from ultralytics, and use tensorrt to create a `.engine` file that can be accelerate by our jetson module.

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a YOLOv8n PyTorch model
model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")

# Export the model
model.export(format="engine")  # creates 'yolov8n.engine'

# Load the exported TensorRT model
trt_model = YOLO("yolov8n.engine")

# Run inference, and store the predict file into ./runs directory
results = trt_model("https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg", save=True)
```

Remember to open a **Jtop** on terminal, click the `6CTRL` tab and change the fan speed.

Back to VSCode and your file. press `ctrl+shift+p` on your keyboard. Type **Python: Select Interpreter** Choose the conda yolov8 environment we created.

Then click the right triangle button on the right top of the VSCode to run python file.

AND Now, just click the `./runs` directory, then you can see the predict result !

**Congratulations!**

### Shortcuts and Tips

- `Ctrl + C`: Stops the current command.
- `Ctrl + Z`: Suspends the current command.
- `Ctrl + R`: Searches command history.
- `Tab`: Auto-completes file and directory names.

### Practice

Try creating a directory, navigating into it, creating a file, and then viewing its contents:

```
bash
Copy code
mkdir my_first_directory
cd my_first_directory
touch hello.txt
echo "Hello, Ubuntu!" > hello.txt
cat hello.txt
```

This should give you a good start with using the command line in Ubuntu. Practice these commands, and you'll become more comfortable with the terminal.

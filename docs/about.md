VitePress is a Static Site Generator (SSG) designed for building fast, 
content-centric websites. In a nutshell, VitePress takes your source content 
written in Markdown, applies a theme to it, and generates static HTML pages 
that can be easily deployed anywhere.

### Write in MarkDown!

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004. Designed for simplicity, 
it allows you to format plain text using easy-to-read syntax that converts 
seamlessly into HTML or other structured formats. Common formatting includes 
headers, lists, bold/italic text, links, images, and code blocks. 
Its readability and ease of use make it popular for writing documentation, 
README files, forum posts (e.g., GitHub, Reddit), and even static websites. 
By using symbols like `#`, `*`, `-`, and `>`, you can focus on content without 
distractions from complex code.

To start using markdown, please refer to wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Examples)
